#### Autodidactic Repo for Deep Learning

I'm creating this repo as a place to put resources, examples and own applications of Deep Learning.

While it does not follow a specific path or order, the advance may resamble the path described in the book [*Deep Learning*](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) textbook.

The code in this repo is written for [Python](https://www.python.org/) using [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) framework.

God-speed!
